### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you for more information.  Therefore, please investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in the report.  Please complete the following steps in advance to help speed up any potential fix.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g.  using incompatible environment components/versions.
- To see if others have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue, check if there is already a bug report for this in the [issues](https://github.com/eslutz/space-adventure-text-game/issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Collect information about the bug:
- Stack trace (Traceback)
- OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
- Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
- Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

#### How To Submit a Good Bug Report

GitHub issues is used to track bugs and errors.  If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [issue](https://github.com/eslutz/space-adventure-text-game/issues/new) and fill out the **Bug Report**.
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that can be followed to recreate the issue.  This usually includes your code.  For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once the report is submitted:

- The issue will be attempted to reproduce with the provided steps.  If there are no reproduction steps a comment will be left asking for details.  Bugs  will not be addressed until there are steps to reproduce the issue.
- If the issue is not able to be reproduced, or no steps are provided after leaving a comment, the issue will be closed.

### Suggesting Enhancements

#### How To Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as much detail as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.  At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.

- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users.
